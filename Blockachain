 

## Running Multiple Nodes

1. **Open Anaconda Spyder.**
2. **Create three separate files or scripts** for each node.
3. **In each file, ensure you specify a different port** (e.g., 5001, 5002, and 5003).
4. **Run each script in separate instances of Spyder** or use the run option to execute them sequentially.

This setup will allow you to have multiple nodes running simultaneously, each acting as a distinct participant in your blockchain network.

## Using Postman

1. **Open Postman.**
2. **To send a GET request:**
   - Set the request type to GET.
   - Enter the URL for one of the nodes to retrieve the blockchain data.
   - Click **Send** to view the current blockchain data.

3. **To send a POST request:**
   - Set the request type to POST.
   - Enter the URL for one of the nodes to create a new transaction.
   - In the body, choose JSON format and enter the transaction details.
   - Click **Send** to create the transaction.

## Deploying Smart Contracts with Ganache

1. **Install Ganache** on your machine if you haven’t already.
2. **Open Ganache** to create a local Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Deploy your smart contract** using your project setup.
4. **Interact with the smart contract** through the Ganache interface or use Postman to send requests to the contract’s endpoint.
